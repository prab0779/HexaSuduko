Explanation
Main Class: This serves as the entry point of the program. It generates a Hexadoku puzzle, prints it, solves it, and then prints the solution.

HexadokuGenerator Class: This class generates a solvable Hexadoku puzzle.
generatePuzzle(): Initializes the board, fills diagonal regions to ensure it's solvable, solves the filled board to make sure it's complete, and then removes some numbers to create the puzzle.
fillEmptyBoard(): Initializes the board with empty cells.
fillDiagonalRegions(): Fills the diagonal 4x4 regions to ensure the puzzle remains solvable.
fillRegion(): Fills a 4x4 region with valid numbers.
isValidMove(): Checks if a move is valid.
removeNumbers(): Removes numbers from the solved board to create the puzzle.
SudokuSolver Class: This class solves the Hexadoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
solveSudoku(): Recursively solves the puzzle.
isValidMove(): Checks if placing a number in a specific cell is valid.
You can run this program in your Java development environment. It will generate a Hexadoku puzzle, solve it, and print both the generated puzzle and the solved puzzle.
